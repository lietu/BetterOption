title: High water consumption
---

Manufacturing of certain products and growing of certain crops can consume a lot of water. Much of the water may in some cases end up back in the natural cycle after evaporation and the following rainfall, but in other cases it's severely contaminated or otherwise used up.

Additionally the water is not available for use by the people, which is of particular concern when areas disproportionately affected are considered. For example in India cotton manufacturing uses a lot of the fresh water supplies, and simultaneously 100 million people lack access to safe sufficient fresh water.
