Microplastics are when small pieces of plastic break off and spread into the environment and pollute it. Many different kinds of plastic products end up contributing to the microplastics problem, and it is not limited to certain kinds of plastics as such.

Some easy ways to avoid contributing to the microplastics issue is to stop buying clothing items with fleece, polyester, nylon, and acrylics. Additionally choosing the plastic-free packaging option when it is available, and avoiding plastic bottles can be potential ways to contribute.
