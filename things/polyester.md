Polyester is used in clothes to make a highly breathing and comfortable fabric, and is for example popular in sportswear. Polyester however contributes to the growing amount of microplastics in the world, and when exposed to fire can burn or melt quite easily making it poorly suitable for certain kinds of work environments.
