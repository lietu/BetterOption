Simple 100% cotton can be a good choice for clothing in many cases, however one thing worth keeping in mind is that there are many different grades of cotton as well as different kinds of weaves that can make a large difference to the properties of the fabric. Similarly the fabric weight and thread count can make a big difference in the properties of the fabric, as well as the quality of the cotton used.

E.g. poplin weave is known for it's breathability, and oxford weave for it's warmth.
