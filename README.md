# Better Option -database

Database of better options for various things with issues.

# Contributing

There are two main ways to contribute to the database, if you want to simply add more content.

1. Pull request - make changes to `options`, `problems`, `things`, `problems/classes`, or `things/categories` with your proposed changes. Don't feel overwhelmed, markdown is reasonably easy to write even for non-techies.
2. Create an [issue](https://github.com/lietu/BetterOption/issues/new) with enough information. Please check the [issue list](https://github.com/lietu/BetterOption/issues) first though to ensure it's not a known issue.

For new content it is a good idea to add information on what the problems exactly are, why they are important, and any references to source material that can be used to verify the claims.

Additionally you can of course contribute to the site's layout and structure, or other scripts. Similarly you can make a direct Pull Request, or submit an issue with the necessary details.
